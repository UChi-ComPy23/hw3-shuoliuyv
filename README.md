# Homework 3 - Initial Value Problems, Differentiation

In this homework, you will find the questions in [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb).  This is convenient for displaying math equations. You can use [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb) for written answers and running simulations/displaying plots.

Please put the class definition for problem 0 in [`euler.py`](euler.py).  This file should contain a Python *module*.

You can run
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
to install the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

|  | Total |
|:-:|:-:|
| Problem 0 | /30 |
| Problem 1 | /20 |
| Problem 2 | /30 |


Correctness will be based on code (i.e. did you provide was was asked for) and the content of [`answers.ipynb`](answers.ipynb).

To get full points on style you should use comments to explain what you are doing in your code and write docstrings for your functions.  In other words, make your code readable and understandable. You should also make your plots nice.

### Autograder

There is no autograder.
